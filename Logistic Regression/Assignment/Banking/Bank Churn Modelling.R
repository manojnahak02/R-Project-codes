## Objective: To determine if a given bank customer will leave or not?
## Columns
##RowNumber
##CustomerId
##Surname
##CreditScore
##Geography -> France, Germany and Spain
##Gender
##Age
##Tenure
##Balance
##NumOfProducts -> How many accounts, bank account affiliated products the person has
##HasCrCard
##IsActiveMember
##EstimatedSalary
##Exited -> Did they leave the bank after all? 0 - Stayed, 1 - Churned

## Gender: Probability of Male churing is 0.55 times as

# Geography: Probability of Germany customer churing is 2.6 times more
#than France
## Geography : Probability of Spain customer churing is 1.06 
#times as France
